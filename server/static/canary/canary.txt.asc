EZRA Warrant Canary
Last Updated: November 29, 2025

As of the date above, EZRA affirms the following statements:

We have not received any National Security Letters (NSLs).
We have not received any subpoenas, court orders, or warrants accompanied by gag orders.
We have not been compelled to compromise or weaken the security of our systems in any way.

Due to the design of EZRA — including zero-knowledge access verification, ephemeral storage, and metadata minimization — we retain no meaningful user information or file activity logs.  
Should legal demands be made that would compromise the privacy, integrity, or security of the EZRA service, the project would be shut down rather than comply.

This statement will be updated at least once every 30 days. 
Failure to update within 45 days may indicate that EZRA has been compelled to act under legal orders.
