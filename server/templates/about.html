<h1>About EZRA</h1>
<p>
EZRA (Ephemeral Zero-Knowledge Relay Archive) is a secure, trustless file-sharing "digital dead drop" tool that combines zero-knowledge cryptography with client-side encryption to protect the privacy of journalists, researchers, whistleblowers, and privacy-conscious users.
</p>

<p>
Files are encrypted before they ever leave your device. Neither the EZRA server nor its operators can decrypt or access the contents. Access is protected using cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs, not logins or passwords.
</p>

<p>
Your file encryption key is never stored, logged, or transmitted to EZRA. Without your secret, the data is mathematically unrecoverable.
</p>

<p>
EZRA is free, open-source, and designed with security, ephemerality, and privacy by default.
