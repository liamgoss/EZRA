<h1>About EZRA</h1>
<p>
EZRA (Ephemeral Zero-Knowledge Relay Archive) is an open-source, privacy-first digital dead drop system built for anonymous, secure file sharing. Designed with journalists, researchers, and security teams in mind, EZRA enables ephemeral, metadata-free transfers without requiring user accounts, IP tracking, or centralized identity.
</p>
<p>
Every file is encrypted with AES-256-GCM and gated behind a zero-knowledge proof, allowing recipients to verify access without revealing their identity. Files are stored briefly, expire automatically, and are inaccessible without valid proof.
</p>
<p>
EZRA is built by <strong>Liam Goss</strong> and maintained as a public project to support press freedom, data minimization, and zero-trust file exchange.
