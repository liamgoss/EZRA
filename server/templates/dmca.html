<h1>DMCA / Takedown Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 2025</p>

<p>
EZRA is a privacy-first platform that uses client-side encryption and ephemeral storage. We do not have access to file contents, encryption keys, or filenames. Files are encrypted in the browser before upload and cannot be decrypted by the server or its operators.
</p>

<p>
As such, we cannot verify, view, or remove specific files based on content alone. We cannot decrypt data to determine if it infringes on intellectual property or contains illegal material.
</p>

<p>
If you believe a specific encrypted file identifier is associated with infringing material, you may submit a request including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The full file ID (derived from the user's secret)</li>
  <li>The corresponding secret value</li>
  <li>Your legal contact information</li>
  <li>Proof of infringement (e.g. registered copyright, link to original work)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We will review the request and, if actionable, apply our file deletion policy. However, due to the zero-access design of this system, EZRA cannot decrypt or verify file content.
</p>

<p>
We reserve the right to respond or ignore such requests based on the technical limitations of the system.
</p>
