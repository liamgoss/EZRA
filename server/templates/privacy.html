<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 2025</p>

<h2>No Logs. No Metadata. No Surveillance.</h2>

<p>
EZRA is designed from the ground up to preserve user anonymity and privacy. We do not collect or retain:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>IP addresses</li>
  <li>Login credentials or identifiers</li>
  <li>Access logs or request history</li>
  <li>File names or contents</li>
  <li>Encryption keys</li>
</ul>

<h2>Client-Side Encryption</h2>
<p>
All files uploaded through EZRA are encrypted in the browser using strong AES-256-GCM encryption. The encryption key is never shared with the server. Even if compelled by legal order, we cannot decrypt your data because we never possess the decryption key.
</p>

<h2>Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h2>
<p>
Access to files is verified using zero-knowledge cryptography. This means you can prove you have the right to access a file—without revealing your identity or credentials.
