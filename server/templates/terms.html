<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 2025</p>

<p>By using EZRA, you agree to the following terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are solely responsible for the content you upload or share through this service.</li>
  <li>You must not use EZRA to distribute unlawful, harmful, or malicious content.</li>
  <li>EZRA is offered “as-is” with no warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.</li>
  <li>All encryption is performed client-side. EZRA does not store or have access to your encryption key. If you lose your secret, your data cannot be recovered.</li>
  <li>EZRA does not log access events, IP addresses, or store identifying metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because of its trustless design, EZRA operators cannot decrypt user data and are therefore unable to comply with requests to access file contents, regardless of jurisdiction.
</p>
