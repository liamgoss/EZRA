    <h1>EZRA Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 2025</p>

    <p>By accessing or using the EZRA platform ("Service"), you agree to the following Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with these Terms, do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You are solely responsible for all content you upload, transmit, access, or share using EZRA.</li>
        <li>You will not use the Service to upload, distribute, or promote content that is unlawful, malicious, infringing, or harmful to others.</li>
        <li>You will not attempt to interfere with or reverse engineer the platform, bypass its security measures, or misuse its functionality in any manner.</li>
        <li>You may not upload content that violates 47 U.S.C. § 223(h) (non-consensual intimate images), child-sexual-abuse laws, or any other applicable statute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. No Warranty and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Service is provided on an <strong>"as-is" and "as-available"</strong> basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.</li>
        <li>We make <strong>no guarantees</strong> as to the availability or accuracy of the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law</strong>, EZRA, its developers, maintainers, and affiliated entities disclaim all liability for any damages, direct or indirect, arising from your use of the Service.</li>
        <li>EZRA deletes uploads automatically after a maximum of 48 hours (or sooner if the uploader set a shorter expiry). We also process valid takedown notices and disable or delete the identified blob within 48 hours as required by law</li>
        <li>Content may be removed or made inaccessible without notice in response to legal or policy violations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Encryption and Data Responsibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All encryption and decryption are performed <strong>exclusively on the client side</strong>. EZRA does not possess, store, or transmit your decryption key or secret.</li>
        <li>If you lose your secret, <strong>your data is unrecoverable</strong>. We cannot assist with recovery, retrieval, or reissuance of any files or access tokens.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for safeguarding your keys, secrets, and proof materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Logging and Privacy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>EZRA is designed to operate without logging IP addresses, file access events, user identifiers, or metadata.</li>
        <li>EZRA does not use cookies, browser fingerprinting, or any form of passive tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Jurisdiction, Legal Compliance, and Data Access</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Due to its zero-knowledge and ephemeral design, <strong>EZRA operators have no technical ability to decrypt user data</strong> or associate files with specific individuals.</li>
        <li>Because data is end-to-end encrypted, EZRA cannot decrypt or view file contents. However, we can delete encrypted blobs when legally obligated or when a valid takedown request identifies the blob-ID (see Takedown Policy).</li>
        <li><strong>Your identity and file content are never logged.</strong></li>
        <li>Users are solely responsible for compliance with applicable laws in their respective regions or countries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Modifications and Termination</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time, for any reason, without notice or liability.</li>
        <li>Changes to these Terms will be posted with an updated effective date. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions regarding these Terms, you may contact us at:<br>
    <strong>contact@ezra.example</strong> or through our public key available on the <a href="/canary">canary page</a>.</p>

    <h2>8. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and EZRA with respect to your use of the Service and supersede all prior communications, representations, or agreements, whether oral or written.</p>
